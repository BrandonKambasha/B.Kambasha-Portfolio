<h4 class="biotext2">
    I am a boy who was born in Harare,Zimbabwe to 2 caring parents who raised me to be the gentleman I am. I grew up in Zimbabwe learnt at an all boys catholic school all the way from pre-school to end of Secondary school. I've always known i had a soft spot for tschnology
    when I recieved my first portable gaming console(PSP) at the age of 11. I knew this because that console and I were inseperable, not just because of gaming reasons I was always curious as to how it functioned. As time progressed at the age of 13 I was able to learn how to trick the 
    console into playing PC games for free. Legal or not all I knew was that I was altering the software of this console and i was enjoying what I was doing.
    From that day I knew my path was a path that involved Software development.
