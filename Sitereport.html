        Web Development in 2020
    </h3>

        <p>
             September 2020 was when I was introduced to web development. At the beginning it was pretty straightforward as we were learning the basics of HTML, and this was something i was already familiar with
             so I was finding the exercises quite easy. As the weeks went by all the information I had learnt a couple of years ago had been covered and it was now time to commence with learning new material. At first the exercises 
             seemed to be difficult, but once you had attempted them, it was nothing too frigtening rather just another exercise to increses my HTML/CSS skill.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning to increase my coding skills was a dream come true, as it was something I had been procrastinating for months, but was just as exciting as when I first learnt to code 
            Obviously it was frustrating when a block of code would not work,especially after spending a decent amount of time attempting to make it work. Although learning to debugg problems within your code was helpful as it did help to reduce the stress and frustration
            levels.Learning about programs such as Visual Studios was very helpful as they were quite helpful with the built in debug features.
            Learning how to design a webpage without tables was something I found quite interesting and key, because previously I thought tables was the only way of design a webpage. This just goes to show how much I enjoyed
            web development as it opened up my mind to different possibilities I did not know exist.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the field of Web Development it was a very successful year as I learnt quite a lot, and managed to come to a realisation that learning doesnt end as I had previously thought I was at the peak of HTML.
            I look forward to 2021 and accept all the challenges to be presented in the field of web debvelopment.

        Module Experience
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        2020 was a year like no other. Starting university learning under such conditions was not a great start to my first year. Learning online didnt prove to be much of a problem, and attending virtual lessons for Web Development was a great experience.
        The vitual lessons held each week were very helpful, with the lecturer giving me assistance when needed.The lessons were clear throughout without any disruptions, which was something I admired quite a lot. When i had an issue with any of the exercises communicating with the lecturer was not much of a hassle, with clear 
        audio when we were communicating.

        Overall I believe I managed to adjust to the new way of learning that was introduced in 2020 due to the circumstances.

    </p>

    <h3> Website Design</h3>
    <p>

        Commencing with the website creation, the design chosen for desktop display was that of having a menu option present on all the pages at the same position, with the menu disappearing into a menu button when entered into mobile version.
        The design chosen to fulfill this functinallity was that of having a navigation panel on the left of the webpage that contains all the menu options. The webpage will be divided into 4 different sections. The left section will be the navigation panel, a main section where the content will be displayed,a header section for the Heading which will be present on each page of the webpage 
        and a footer section to contain a link to be able to navigate to the top of the page when clicked once reached the bottom of the page.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        In the mobile version of the website, the menu options will no longer be present on a navigation panel but rather inside a hamburger icon menu present at the top left of the webpage. The header, main and footer will remain in their respective positions adjusting to fit with the width of the mobile device(800px maximum).
    </p>

    <p>
        Across all the webpages in the desktop display the sections will be fixed in a grid layout with the naigation bar, header and footer being present in their original states on all the pages. The main section will be the only section changeing to display content accordingly to
        each page.
        In the mobile version the hamburger icon menu, the header and the footer will be in the same positions on all the pages with once again the main section the only section changeing to satisfy the selected page.

    </p>

    <p>
        The fonts chosen for the webpages were: Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell and Calibri. These were the fonts used throughout the development of the website on all the webpages.
        As for the theme and the colours of the website, an overall theme colour combination of blue, white, yellow and black was used on all the webpages. A lightblue background on the header,naigation and footer sections, with white text. Yellow for the border for these sections and underlining for the Subtopics for each page.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation & Testing</h3>
    <p>
        To begin the project, the first step was dividing the page into 4 different sections. This was accomplished using "display:grid" assigning each area a grid name then arranging these areas in the required positions in the CSS.
        In the images below it was the outcome after the grid layout was applied, leading to a webpage subdivided into 4 sections.

    </p>

    <h3 class="subtopic">Desktop Menu</h3>
    <div><img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/gridlayout.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/gridlayout2.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/gridlayout3.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>
        With the webpage divided the next step was to have a menu option for the desktop version of the website. The chosen menu type was that of having the webpages listed on the left side of the webpage in the navigation panel. A font stlye of Robotto was applied to the list of the webpage links.
        Then some styling and animation was added to these menu options. A hover effect was added as well as an animation. So when hovered upon the menu option will have a different background colour and an animation would take place of rotating in the 360 degrees before being clicked on.

    </p>

    <h3 class="subtopic">Desktop Menu</h3>
    <div>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/menu3.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/menu1.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/menu2.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>
        With the menu added to the desktop version,it needed to be made to adjust for the mobile version to disappear into a hamburger menu icon. To do so in the mobile version css, the icon was created using links and adding bottom and top borders to them without any content asigned to them. With
        the hamburger icon created the next step is to add an animation for when its clicked. To have the icon toggle between 2 states, another hamburger icon was added on top of the previous one, except with the same colour so that when the next hamburger icon appears to show the menu it will be identical
        leading to the illusion of making it look like a button that performs a function. Below are images which show the css for the links for the 2 links of the hamburger icon made with css, images of the css of one of the menu links and the toggle states using the ":target" function
        to switch between the 2 menu links for show menu and hide menu. The final images being the 2 toggled states of the menu button with the annimation have taken place. 
    </p>

    <img class="shots" src="Images/Screenshots/mobilemenu1.jpg">
   
    <h4 class="biotext2">
        This is the menu button as it appears in the mobile version of the website, currently the hidemenu hamburger icon being displayed with the menu hidden. The hamburger icon has acurved edges from the border-radius being reduced.
    </h4>
    
   <p>
        Now when the menu button is clicked an animation takes place to slide the menu and a menu pops up showing the different options to select to navigate to a certain webpage.
        Below is the css for the menu icon and the toggle states performed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtopic">Mobile Menu</h3>
    <div>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/mobilemenu2.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/mobilemenu3.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/mobilemenu4.jpg">
        
    </div>

    <p>
        The menu button and the menu panel having been added to respective css's the next step was to add content to the pages which was done so by adding them to the main section of each 
        webpage, having a similar style for the sub-heading across all the webpages. Which is evident as you navigate through the website using the respective menu option.
        The Contact page contains a form that was added and cotains a submit button that will load up the users email. To produce such usage of the "mailTo" function was used.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtopic">Forms Coding</h3>
    <div>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact1.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact2.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact3.jpg">
    </div>    

    <P>
        With the coding in place for the form page with the above coding, the images below show the outcome, with the labels having a blue backgroud accordingly with the theme, yellow text fields with placeholder text for the entry of the 
        users details, and below the fields are the buttons that have a hover effect of changeing colour from black to red.
    </P>

    <h3 class="subtopic">Forms</h3>
    <div>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact4.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact5.jpg">
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Screenshots/contact6.jpg">
    </div>    

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
       The above design was selected as the vision that was being seeked was one of making the website not only stand-out, but also be colourful and be an image that is constantly visualised by the brain
       even sub-consciously. <a href= "https://kinsta.com/blog/website-color-schemes/#7-pants-creative--accessible">Colour theme link.</a>
       The link is for the website where the idea for having a color combination that reaches the mind was found.
       Overall the website managed to reach the requirements and proved to be functional.
