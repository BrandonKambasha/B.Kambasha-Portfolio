        Web Development in 2020
    </h3>

        <p>
             September 2020 was when I was introduced to web development. At the beginning it was pretty straightforward as we were learning the basics of HTML, and this was something i was already familiar with
             so I was finding the exercises quite easy. As the weeks went by all the information I had learnt a couple of years ago had been covered and it was now time to commence with learning new material. At first the exercises 
             seemed to be difficult, but once you had attempted them, it was nothing too frigtening rather just another exercise to increses my HTML/CSS skill.
        </p>

            Learning to increase my coding skills was a dream come true, as it was something I had been procrastinating for months, but was just as exciting as when I first learnt to code 
            Obviously it was frustrating when a block of code would not work,especially after spending a decent amount of time attempting to make it work. Although learning to debugg problems within your code was helpful as it did help to reduce the stress and frustration
            levels.Learning about programs such as Visual Studios was very helpful as they were quite helpful with the built in debug features.
            Learning how to design a webpage without tables was something I found quite interesting and key, because previously I thought tables was the only way of design a webpage. This just goes to show how much I enjoyed
            web development as it opened up my mind to different possibilities I did not know exist.
        </p>

            In the field of Web Development it was a very successful year as I learnt quite a lot, and managed to come to a realisation that learning doesnt end as I had previously thought I was at the peak of HTML.
            I look forward to 2021 and accept all the challenges to be presented in the field of web debvelopment.

        Module Experience
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        2020 was a year like no other. Starting university learning under such conditions was not a great start to my first year. Learning online didnt prove to be much of a problem, and attending virtual lessons for Web Development was a great experience.
        The vitual lessons held each week were very helpful, with the lecturer giving me assistance when needed.The lessons were clear throughout without any disruptions, which was something I admired quite a lot. When i had an issue with any of the exercises communicating with the lecturer was not much of a hassle, with clear 
        audio when we were communicating.

        Overall I believe I managed to adjust to the new way of learning
